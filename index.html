        <p>Nurse by night, programmer by day. I always had a interest in technology and futuristic ideas like flying cars, hologram
          screens, etc. But my parents wanted me to pursue a career in the medical field. I became a nurse in 2016 and have
          been working in various fields - medical/surgical, pediatrics home health services, and psycholoyy. I like helping
          people but I couldn't find a field that I was truely passionate about that also helps people. In 2017, I started
          learning coding on my own using sites such as pluralsight, codeschool, freecodecamp, w3school, and other resources.
          The more time I spent learning, the more I realized how interesting coding was. I joined a UT coding bootcamp in
          April 2018 and that was the deciding factor to finally fully transition into becoming a software engineer. </p>
        <p>I did my prerequisites at Lone Star community college and University of Houston main campus. I received an assoicate
          of science at Lone Star before going to UT health science center - School of Nursing in 2015. Graduated in 2016
          with a bachelor of science in nursing and I have been working as a nurse ever since.</p>
        <p>Relevant technology: ASP.NET/C#, javascript, html, css, jquery, sql, LINQ</p>
